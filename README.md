## 🧠 The Business Problem

A digital payments company processes hundreds of thousands of transactions per day. Only 0.17% are fraudulent — but that small percentage represents millions in annual losses through chargebacks, operational costs, and reputational damage.

The fraud team cannot manually review every transaction. They need a system that:
- **Detects fraud automatically** with high accuracy
- **Minimizes false positives** — blocking a legitimate transaction also has a cost
- **Prioritizes alerts by risk level** — so the team focuses where it matters most
- **Quantifies business impact** — not just model metrics, but actual dollars saved

**This project builds that system from scratch.**

## ✅ The Solution

A complete fraud detection pipeline that trains and compares three machine learning models on 284K+ real credit card transactions, applies SMOTE to handle extreme class imbalance (0.17% fraud rate), optimizes the decision threshold for maximum business value, and delivers a real-time risk monitoring dashboard in Power BI.

> *From 284K raw transactions to a production-ready fraud scoring system — detecting 97% of fraud with only 292 false alarms and $55,002 in net benefit.*

## ⚠️ Class Imbalance — The Core Challenge

With only 0.17% fraud rate, standard models trained on raw data would simply predict "legitimate" for everything and achieve 99.83% accuracy — completely useless for fraud detection.

**Solution applied:**
- **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) applied to training set only — never to test set
- Raised fraud ratio from 0.17% to 9% in training data
- Stratified train/test split to preserve class distribution
- Evaluation focused on Recall, Precision, AUC-ROC and Average Precision — not accuracy

## 🎯 Risk Level Segmentation

All transactions scored and classified into 4 risk tiers:

| Risk Level | Transactions | Fraud Rate | Avg Score | Action |
|------------|-------------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Critical | 604 | **78.5%** | 0.974 | Immediate block |
| High | 196 | 1.5% | 0.689 | Priority review |
| Medium | 752 | 0.3% | 0.413 | Standard review |
| Low | 283,255 | 0.0% | 0.006 | Auto-approve |

> **Key insight:** When the model flags a transaction as Critical, it is correct 78.5% of the time — a 455x improvement over the base fraud rate.

Beyond the anonymized PCA features (V1-V28), the following business-relevant indicators were engineered:

| Feature | Logic | Fraud Signal |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `Amount_log` | Log transform of amount | Reduces skew, improves model |
| `Amount_scaled` | Standardized amount | Normalized for model input |
| `Is_small_amount` | Amount < $10 | 2x higher fraud rate |
| `Is_round_amount` | Amount % 1 == 0 | 1.9x higher fraud rate |
| `Is_night` | Hour between 10pm–6am | Behavioral risk indicator |
